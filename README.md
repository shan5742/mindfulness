This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## 100 Days of Mindfulness

This is a simple application made with `create-react-app` that will display a random challenge on each visit. This challenge will be based around taking you out of your comfort zone to help you overcome fears and feel better within yourself.

Initially this is very basic, but I hope to add more features in the future.

## Future Work

**Authentication** I hope to add the ability for users to sign up and not see the same challenges they have done before.

**Completion of challenges** The ability to mark a challenge as complete.

**Notifications** Add notifications to give user a new task (daily) and then remind them throughout the day.

**Certificate of completion** Offer some type of confirmation that the user has completed the 100 challenges.
